## Summary

TODO:
The introduction section includes credible evidence on most of the concepts mentioned that makes the reader develop a positive attitude towards the content they are reading. There is a smooth flow in the transition of the paragraphs which contributes to better understanding of the concepts mentioned. The author concludes the project by stating the purpose of the project in bullet points that captivates the reade's attention and helps them summarize all the text that had been written. 
There were some grammartical changes that I would propose, for instance, like having the noun and pronoun next to each other as that would help indicate what the author is actually referring to. Some ideas were pretty broad and they could be narrowed down. Overall, this project is framed in an organized manner and making the proposed changes will make it a great introduction.
